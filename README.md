PAGE NAMING
to name the pages. Name it whatever you want but follow it up with an "_" for example
"index_page" or "profile_page"

HTML/CSS
page has an indivudal html page and each page has it's own css
I don't know but having one gigantic css is cumbersome to follow. So I figured each page should get it's own css
